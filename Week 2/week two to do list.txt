Continue "Week 2 - Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries" from "Adding  elements" slide

Adding elements

Adding to a list: append(), insert(), extend(), and using + operator

No adding to tuples since they are immutable

Adding to a set: add() and update()

Adding to a dictionary by specify a value for a new key or updating it

Removing elements

Removing from a list: del, set slice to empty list, pop(), remove(), and clear()

No removing from tuples since they are immutable

Removing from a set: remove() ,  discard(), and clear()

Removing from a dictionary: del, pop(), and clear()

Modifying elements

Modifying list elements: assignment and slice

No tuples modification since they are immutable

Modifying set elements: can not be changed, but remove then add

Modifying dictionary elements: using assignment similarly to list elements

Sorting elements

sort() method (lists only and in-place)

sorted() method (applies to all and returns a list)

Joining elements using join()

Special string operations

Strings as tuples

Splitting strings

Special set operations: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, comparing sets

Looping through a collection

for loops

break and continue

Comprehensions
